# udacity-self-driving-car-nanodegree-program

My research focus is combination of the machine learning algorithms and real time robotics. For years I study on aerial vehicles but after dozens of crash one has a right to seek a platform whose feet touches the ground:).  Udacity's seld driving car engineering program is an excellent platform to implement these algorithms on a car, which aligns with my thesis project. Here you can find jupyter notebooks and project reports along with multimedia, the content lacks some guidance but it will be enhanced soon, stay tuned!
